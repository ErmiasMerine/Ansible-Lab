Created three VM Linux servers using Linode. 
The first server acted as the control node while the other two servers acted as host nodes.
I than used the command line to use Ansible to have the control node send commands to the host nodes.
I also created a playbook in nanotester.yml to check if nano was installed in either of the servers.
This lab served as an introduction for me to get comfortable with Ansible.
